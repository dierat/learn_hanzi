#Learn Hanzi

Learn Hanzi is an app for learning to read Chinese characters, built with Meteor js. 

Hanzi is the Chinese system of writing which uses logograms to represent words and phrases. The system is also used in the Japanese (where it is called kanji), Korean (where it's called hanja), and Vietnamese (where it's called chữ Nôm) written systems.

Learn Hanzi on four main methods for learning logograms:
<ul>
	<li>simple to complex - Start with the roots before moving to characters that use those roots, and start with the simplest roots before moving into more visually complex roots. That way you can expand your knowledge radius slowly and build new information on existing infrastructures.</li>
	<li>the 2000 most commonly used mandarin characters - Only learn the characters that are commonly used to maximize the chance of using your knowledge when reading real-world Mandarin.</li>
	<li>spaced repetition - Spend more time working on characters that are new to you or are particularly difficult for you while also periodically refresh your memory of characters you are already familiar with.</li>
	<li>mnemonics - Learn the history and concepts behind the characters and use visual memory tricks to help you memorize the characters quickly and permanently.</p>
	<li>infinite loop - Don’t waste time choosing what to practice or how; just open the app and start (or continue) learning.</li>
</ul>
