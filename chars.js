['42','口','mouth','photo','mouth.jpeg','The characters for "mouth, opening" and "enclosure" are actually different, but appear the same. If the square is surrounding the character, it means "enclosure". If it is next to or inside other characters, it means "mouth, opening".'],

['46','白','white','large seal script','white.svg','Drawn originally as an acorn (but with a different meaning), this character became associated with the white color of the acorn\'s flesh. Over time it\'s shape changed to mimic "sun" (日), but the stem of the acorn remains as a dash on top.'],

['48','夕','evening','large seal script','evening.svg','"Evening" is represented with a curved crescent moon. Note the similarity with (or the difference from) "moon" (月)  which is also an abstracted crescent moon.

['49','肉','meat','large seal script','meat.svg','"Meat" looks like two "person" characters (人) in an container, but the symbols inside are actually ribs and the container is the torso of an animal.'],

The bottom right stroke in "shell" is straight.'],

The top element (生) actually represents a plant, and the bottom part (丹 means "dye" or "color" - together they mean the color of plants, or "green", but the character can also mean "blue".

['77','干','dry','photo','dry.jpg','The character for "dry" looks like a \'T\' with a second, longer horizontal line across the middle. One way to remember this is that clothes lines are often attached to a two big T-shaped structures. When viewed from the side, the two T\'s overlap to create one shape with two horizontal lines. Just remember that the top horizontal line is shorter than the lower one.'],

['79','舌','tongue','photo','tongue.jpeg','The bottom element of "tongue" is "mouth" (口). The top half is thought to have originally meant a forked tongue or a forked weapon. It also looks similar to the top half of "hand" (手), which may be helpful for remembering the meaning because a tongue is like the mouth\'s version of a hand.'],
['80','牛','cow','drawing','cow.jpg','The character for "cow" was originally a cross with a half-circle shape on top representing a cow\'s horns.

The character for "go" actually represents a foot pointed downwards (so the horizontal line is the back of the foot and the bottom of the character is the front).'],
['86','殳','weapon','small seal inscription','weapon.svg','"Weapon" shows a "right hand" (又) holding some kind of tool. The tool looks like "table" (几), but it may be easier to remember the meaning of this character if you see it as "knife" (刀), which looks very similar.'],

That is easier to see in the character\'s earlier versions, which are more literal.. '],
['91','马','horse','oracle bone inscription','horse.svg','The character for "horse" is a very abstracted drawing of a side view of a horse that is running to the left.

The horizontal line above the feet is the horse\'s back. In the simplified form, the legs have been replaced by a single horisontal line, and all that is left of the head and main is a single square.'],
['92','鸟','bird','oracle bone inscription','bird.svg','"Bird" is very similar to "horse" (马) but with an added eye and a dash on the head for feather or plume.'],

['99','邑','city','photo','city.jpg','"City" looks like an "enclosure" (囗) above a person kneeling (similar to "seal" - 卩) because a city is a group of people in a specified space who have a form of government that they obey.'],
